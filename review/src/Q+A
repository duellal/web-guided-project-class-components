Why would you want state to only be accessible within the component (this.state)?
- Anytime you make a react component, state is nested inside that component. You can share that state with other components using props. You can also modify that state within other components.

If it's possible to create a component with both functional/Class based approaches, which should you take?
- If you are making something from scratch or is new, use functional components as it's fast and easy. 

You are only going to be using Class based components if you are working on a project that already uses them.

Do you ever extend an established Class rather than React.Component?
- Absolutely. Extends is about object oriented programming - it's not just a React thing.
